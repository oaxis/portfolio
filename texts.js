            About me
            ###############################################

            Hello, I'm William Evieux,
    
            I wrote my first computer program when I was 9, 
            sold my development services on IT forums when I was 15, 
            got a prize for a contactless payment prototype working 
            with an NFC chip injected into my hand in high school. 
            Became a freelancer when I was 18 and got over 60 customers worldwide. 
    
            IT and innovation are my passions and I have
            devoted myself to it all my life.
            I believe that computer science is the best way to solve problems
            and I am always looking for new ways to improve myself.
    
            If you're looking for someone who gets the job done in
            the most efficient and optimal way, I garantee you that I will.
    
            find out more about me by typing 'projects', 'contact', 'skills' or 'softskills'.
